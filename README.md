learn about Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling methods.
It follows on from my previous project on 
Bayesian Analysis of beam models."

"We use mathematical models to predict the behaviour of physical systems,
whether it be structural beams, bridges, cells or circuits.
This project aims to use a Bayesian approach to assess quantitatively
how well two different beam models, namely Euler-Bernolli beam theory
nd Finite Element Analysis (FEA), predict the deflection of a thin shelled structure.
he thin shelled structure is a 'gyroid beam' that has been 3D printed."
